Bowling Master (c) TripHazard 2024 - Privacy Policy

Bowling Master uses a matchmaking system to connect players together, which in-turn requires your current IP address to be forwarded to the matchmaking server. This data is only held until a game is found (or until the search times out), then it is deleted from the server. This data is not sent with anything else meaning it is completely anonymous. It is also not shared with any other players due to the matchmaking using Unity's relay system.

If you have any concerns about Bowling Master you may contact the developer by email: george.yarwood@gmail.com
